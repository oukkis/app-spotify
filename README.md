Spotify App
===========

Prerequisites: node.js and its package manager (npm) installed.

Clone the angular-seed repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/oukkis/app-spotify.git
```

In the app-spotify folder run 'npm install' to use bower to download the Angular framework into the app/bower_components directory.

```
npm install
```

Run the application:

```
npm start
```

Now you can browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.
